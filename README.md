# pickup-bball

App to organize a group of folks to get together and play basketball weekly.

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - API routes, served from inside the TanStack Start Worker
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Hosting for the whole site, single Worker
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **Cloudflare D1** - SQLite database
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## How it is hosted

The whole site runs as a single Cloudflare Worker on the free plan:

- `apps/web` is a TanStack Start app built with the Cloudflare Vite plugin. Static assets are served by Workers Assets and pages are server-rendered in the Worker.
- The Hono API lives inside the same Worker at `/api/*` (`apps/web/src/server/app.ts`, mounted by `apps/web/src/routes/api/$.ts`). Same origin means no CORS and ordinary same-site cookies.
  - `/api/auth/*` - Better Auth
  - `/api/rpc` - oRPC (the web app calls this from the browser and calls the router directly during SSR)
  - `/api/reference` - OpenAPI reference
  - `/api/health` - health check
- The database is Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) accessed through Drizzle via the `DB` binding. Env vars, secrets and bindings come from `cloudflare:workers` (typed in `packages/env/env.d.ts`, which must match `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`).

## Local development

1. Create `apps/web/.dev.vars` from `apps/web/.dev.vars.example` and set a random `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
2. Apply the migrations to the local D1 database (stored under `apps/web/.wrangler/`):

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate:local
```

3. Start the dev server. Vite runs the server side inside workerd, so bindings behave as they do in production:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Headcount data

The "This week's headcount" board is shared: names live in the `rsvp` table in D1, one row per name per week. Each row carries the ISO date of its Monday (`week_of`), computed in the gym's timezone (`RUN_TIMEZONE` in `packages/api/src/run.ts`), so the board starts empty every Tuesday and past weeks stay as history. Anyone can add a name or flip it In/Out; no sign-in is required, matching the design. The oRPC procedures are `rsvp.list`, `rsvp.add`, and `rsvp.toggle` in `packages/api/src/routers/rsvp.ts`. Roster, rules and game conditions are plain content in `apps/web/src/content/run.ts`.

## Database changes

1. Edit the schema in `packages/db/src/schema`.
2. Generate a migration: `pnpm run db:generate`. This writes SQL into `packages/db/src/migrations`, which is what wrangler applies.
3. Apply it locally with `pnpm run db:migrate:local`, and to production with `pnpm run db:migrate:remote`.

Inspect the local database with `pnpm --filter web exec wrangler d1 execute DB --local --command "select * from user"`.

## Deploying to Cloudflare

One-time setup:

1. Log in: `pnpm --filter web exec wrangler login`.
2. Create the database: `pnpm --filter web exec wrangler d1 create pickup-bball-db` and paste the returned id into `database_id` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`.
3. Set the auth secret: `pnpm --filter web exec wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
4. Apply migrations to production: `pnpm run db:migrate:remote`.
5. Deploy: `pnpm run deploy`.
6. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` `vars` to the URL wrangler printed (or your custom domain) and deploy again.

After that, either run `pnpm run deploy` from your machine, or connect the repo to Cloudflare Workers Builds so every push to `main` deploys. For Workers Builds use root directory `/`, build command `pnpm run build`, and deploy command `pnpm run db:migrate:remote && pnpm --filter web exec wrangler deploy`.
